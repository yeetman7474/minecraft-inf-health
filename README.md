Minecraft Health Cheat Trainer (Python Script)
Description
This Python script is designed for personal use in single-player Minecraft games to provide infinite health by modifying the game’s memory during gameplay. This script interacts with the Minecraft process to keep the player’s health at the maximum level (20.0 health points) at all times.

How the Script Works
This Python script works by accessing Minecraft’s memory through its process (Java). It identifies the memory address where the health value is stored and continuously modifies it to ensure the player’s health is always set to 20.0 (full health).

Memory Address
The health value in Minecraft is stored in a specific memory address that can change with each game session. To find the correct memory address:

Use Cheat Engine to identify the memory address where health is stored.

Replace the address in the script (health_address = 0x12345678) with the correct one for your game session.

Legal and Ethical Notice
Ethical Use: This script is provided for educational purposes. You should only use this script in single-player games and for personal use. Cheating or modifying game data in multiplayer games may result in penalties such as account bans.

Terms of Service: This script is not endorsed by Mojang or Minecraft. By using this tool, you acknowledge that you are fully responsible for any consequences, including potential violations of Minecraft's terms of service.

Troubleshooting
Minecraft is not found:

Ensure Minecraft is running before executing the script.

Make sure the correct process name (javaw.exe) is used in the script.

Script Crashes or Freezes:

If the script crashes, it may be due to incorrect memory addresses. Use Cheat Engine to confirm the correct address for health.

Restart the game and re-run the script if necessary.
